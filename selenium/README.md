# Selenium Boilerplate

Python 2 and 3

Requires:
  1. selenium
  2. [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver)
  3. FireFox

Optional:

  1. pyvirtualdisplay

Very Basic Boilerplate that I use for building scripts that headlessly download files using selenium and FireFox.

Note: If download folder doesn't exist it will be created

Note: Using virtualenv is recomended

# Please note no security considerations are built into the script
