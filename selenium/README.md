# Selenium Boilerplate

Python 2 and 3

Requires selenium and pyvirtualdisplay

Very Basic Boilerplate that I use for building scripts that download files using selenium and FireFox.

  * Expects a FireFox profile to be named `profile` and located in the same folder as the script
  * Expects a folder named `downloads` to be located in the same folder as the script

# Please note no security considerations are built into the script
